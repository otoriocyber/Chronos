# consider pinning these versions, pip doesn't resolve dependency collisions, and without versions will intall the latest...
# so it can break at some point in the future.
# which versions to use? in your test environment, run 'pip list' and see what it actually installed...
# python-registry==1.3.1
# (note: this project is not a python "pacakge" that is going to be installed by someone in their project,
# but a stand-alone program, so we are safe to pin the exact versions).
